Network Time Protocol (NTP) is an interntet protocol to synchronize with computer clock time sources in a network.
The following three steps are involved in the NTP synchronization process:
1. The NTP client initiates a time-request exchange with the NTP server.
2. The client is then able to calculate the link delay and its local offset and adjust its local clock to match the clock at the server's computer.
3. As a rule six ecxhanges over a period of about five to 10 minutes are required to initially set the clock.

NTP uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to synchronize computer clock times with extreme precision.
